An extremely slow, inflexible and inefficient, incredibly tailored to the exact data files for my HAB1 - SAM+BUZZ launch.

It takes:
* A directory of Canon point-and-shoot camera files and iterates over them.
* Adjusts the time stamps
* Finds the matching photo from the Raspberry Pi camera
* Finds the matching telemetry data from SAM, or BUZZ if SAM was offline
* Finds the matching sensor data from SAM as well

It then shoves the two images next to each other and overlays some text of telemetry and sensor data on the image.

It's terribly inefficient how it greps the telemetry log files, but it works as a PoC.

Bugs in the tracker that it compensates for:
* Canon A810 clock was out of sync by 56 days
* Raspberry Pi was out of sync by ~1 day so we ignore timestamps from it, and instead rely on GPS times
* The internal temperature sensor byte -> int conversion was wrong and the logs converted it as an unsigned int.
